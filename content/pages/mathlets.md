Ordinary Differential Equations Manipulatives ("Mathlets")

This course employs a carefully developed set of dynamic computer applets called "Mathlets." They are used in lecture occasionally. Each problem set contains a problem based around one or another of them. ({{% resource_link d82413a8-26f3-8ed5-6f10-5da631b89646 "PDF" %}})

{{% resource_link "bd87b38a-d52f-4a47-afd7-f17950ff4985" "The Mathlets Gallery" %}} can be found on the MIT Interactive Mathematics Site. Each Mathlet has an associated "Help" file which will open in a new window and provide user instructions.

Funding for the development of the Mathlets was provided by a grant from the {{% resource_link "4b85b3ad-f08c-416a-8f49-25f919696776" "The d'Arbeloff Fund" %}} for Excellence in MIT Education as part of The d'Arbeloff Interactive Mathematics Project (d'A I M P).
